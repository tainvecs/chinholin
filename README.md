# Personal Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.


## Installation
```
$ yarn
```

## Local Development
```
$ yarn start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.


## Build
```
$ yarn build
```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.


## Deployment
```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```
If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
